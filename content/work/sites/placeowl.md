[placeowl.com](https://placeowl.com) is an owl themed image placeholder service. Images are ubiquitous on the web. Web engineers often need stand-in images when developing web sites if designs are not complete or live content is unavailable.

That is where a placeholder image service is valuable.  This site provides dynamically sized images as needed.

<pre style="display:inline-block;">&lt;img src="https://placeowl.com/300" /&gt;</pre>

This will insert an square, owl themed placeholder image sized 300 pixels wide and 300 pixels high.  There's more explanation and options listed at [placeowl.com](https://placeowl.com).

[placeowl.com](https://placeowl.com) is built with [PHP 8](https://www.php.net/) and [Slim](https://www.slimframework.com/), a PHP micro framework. The site also uses MySQL for data storage and Redis for caching.
